                <p>Horster. I expect to be ready to sail next week.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Mrs. Stockmann. I suppose you are going to America?</p>
                <br>

                <p>Horster. Yes, that is the plan.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Mrs. Stockmann. Then you won't be able to take part in the coming
                election?</p>
                <br>

                <p>Horster. Is there going to be an election?</p>
                <br>

                <p>Billing. Didn't you know?</p>
                <br>

                <p>Horster. No, I don't mix myself up with those things.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Billing. But do you not take an interest in public affairs?</p>
