<p>[Lowering his voice a little.] I don't want the poor children to know
how I am.</p>

<h6>SOLNESS</h6>
<p>Yes, you have been looking very poorly of late.</p>

<h6>BROVIK</h6>
<p>It will soon be all over with me. My strength is ebbing--from day to
day.</p>

<h6>SOLNESS</h6>
<p>Won't you sit down?</p>

<h6>BROVIK</h6>
<p>Thanks--may I?</p>
